validation	von Trier	The first █████████ movie i've ever seen was breaking the waves. Sure a nice movie but it definitely stands in the shadow of europa.
training	Ivan Trojan	The actors are excellent, especially ███████████, whose final scenes are a real master piece! I highly recommend this film, it's one of the most original ones I've ever seen!
validation	Posey	Funny women █████ in this popular indie film.
